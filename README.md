SDR Synthetic Stereo Demonstration

**[Please listen with stereo headphones to hear the binaural effects]**

I placed SDRs 20 km apart, tuned to 10Mhz. Both receivers were listening to two shortwave radio stations: WWV in Colorado and WWVH in Hawaii. My receivers were in California. The recordings were synchronized using their GPS timing data. The two mono signals are combined (left and right audio channels respectively) to create binaural stereo.

The female voice is coming from Kauai, Hawaii. It sounds like it is coming from the left.

The male voice is coming from Fort Collins, Colorado. It sounds like it's coming from the right.

Tones are coming from both sources.

The experiment takes advantage of the natural processing in our hearing system to detect hidden directional information in radio signals.
